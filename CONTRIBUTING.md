# Contributing to DisCat 🐱

Thanks for your interest in DisCat!

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

DisCat is a **fork-friendly, minimal-support** project. This means:

- ✅ **Forks are encouraged!** Customize it for your needs
- ✅ **Pull requests welcome** for bug fixes and improvements
- ⚠️ **Limited support** - The maintainer has limited time
- 📚 **Documentation first** - Read the docs before opening issues

## 🐛 Found a Bug?

1. **Check existing issues** - Someone may have already reported it
2. **Try the latest version** - It might already be fixed
3. **Open an issue** with:
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Your Python version and OS

## 💡 Want a Feature?

**Best approach: Fork it and build it yourself!**

DisCat is designed to be hackable. If you need a feature:
1. Fork the repo
2. Add your feature
3. Optional: Submit a PR if you think others would benefit

Pull requests for features are welcome but may not be merged immediately.

## 🔧 Submitting Pull Requests

**Good PRs:**
- ✅ Bug fixes
- ✅ Documentation improvements
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility fixes
- ✅ Performance improvements
- ✅ Code cleanup

**Please include:**
- Clear description of what changed
- Why the change is needed

## 📝 Code Style

- Keep it simple and readable
- Follow existing code patterns
- Comment complex logic
- No new dependencies unless absolutely necessary

## 🆘 Support

**This is a minimal-support project.** Please:
- ❌ Don't expect immediate responses
- ✅ Search existing issues first
- ✅ Help others in the community
- ✅ Consider fixing bugs yourself

## 🐱 Fork-Friendly

DisCat is **designed to be forked**. If you need:
- Custom metadata extractors
- Different export formats
- Integration with other tools
- Your own features

**Fork it!** You don't need permission. That's what open source is for.
